# 👋 Hi, I'm @vicliu624

## 🧠 My Worldview: Architecture as Worldview

I believe that **software engineering is fundamentally about distinction-making and world-interpretation**, not just code implementation. My core philosophy is:

> **"To exist is to be distinguished"** - *George Spencer-Brown*

### 🌟 What This Means

- **Software is not just tools** - it's a medium for interpreting and structuring reality
- **Every architectural decision** represents a way of distinguishing and organizing the world
- **We don't just write code** - we create structured interpretations of reality
- **The future belongs to those** who can distinguish, interpret, and structure reality through software

### 🎯 My Mission

To help software engineers transition from **tool-first** to **interpretation-first** thinking, elevating their cognitive capabilities from mere implementation to world-construction.

## 👀 I'm interested in

- **Axon Framework** - Event-driven architecture and CQRS implementation
- **STM32** - Embedded systems and hardware-software integration
- **Explicit Architecture** - My philosophical framework for software design
- **Cognitive Architecture** - How we think about and structure complex systems

## 🌱 I'm currently learning

- **Philosophy of Software** - The deeper meaning behind what we build
- **Cognitive Science** - How the mind structures reality
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - Systems that tell their own stories

## 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on

- **Explicit Architecture implementations** - Real-world applications of my philosophical framework
- **AI + Embedded Systems** - Bringing intelligence to the edge
- **Reactive Systems** - Event-driven architectures that scale
- **Philosophical Software Engineering** - Projects that challenge conventional thinking
- **Open Source Architecture Tools** - Frameworks that embody distinction-making principles

## 🚀 My Current Focus

I'm working on **"Architecture as Worldview"** - a comprehensive exploration of how software architecture reflects and shapes our understanding of reality. This isn't just about technical patterns, but about the philosophical foundations of how we organize and interpret the world through code.

### 🔮 Why This Matters in the AI Era

- **AI can generate code** - but cannot autonomously distinguish the world
- **Frameworks change** - but cognitive structures remain stable  
- **Tools evolve** - but interpretation power is timeless

The engineers who will thrive are those who can **think architecturally** - not just use tools, but design the structures that define reality.

## 📚 My Work

### 🎯 Core Philosophy
- **Explicit Architecture** - Making architectural distinctions explicit and interpretable
- **Cognitive Transition** - From tool users to world interpreters
- **Distinction-Making** - The fundamental act of software engineering

### 🔬 Research Areas
- **Software Ontology** - What software really is
- **Architectural Cognition** - How we think about complex systems
- **Event-Driven Reality** - Systems that unfold through time
- **AI-Human Collaboration** - What humans do that AI cannot

---

## 🌟 Fun Facts

- I see **every software system as a worldview** - a way of interpreting reality
- I believe **programmers are philosophers** - we create the structures that define existence
- I'm fascinated by **the intersection of technology and ontology** - how code shapes reality
- I think **the best software tells a story** - not just about what it does, but about how it sees the world

*"We truly write not programs, but a structured interpretation of the world."*
